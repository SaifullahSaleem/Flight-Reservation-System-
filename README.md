1 Introduction 
1.1 Background 
The airline industry witnesses a continuous surge in passenger traffic, demanding robust systems to streamline 
flight bookings, manage passenger information, and ensure operational efficiency. The Airline Reservation 
System project aims to address these requirements by developing a comprehensive system that enhances user 
experience and optimizes flight operations. 
1.2 Objectives and Scope 
The primary objectives include: 
• Creating an intuitive interface for passengers to make flight reservations securely. 
• Efficiently managing flight schedules, departure/arrival details, and passenger data. 
• Enabling easy access to accurate flight information and reservation status. 
The scope encompasses the development of a user-friendly system catering to passengers’ reservation needs 
while integrating functionalities for flight management and data security. 
2 System Architecture 
2.1 System Components 
The system architecture encompasses the following key components: 
• FlightType: Represents flight details including flight number, departure/arrival times, and passenger 
count. 
• RouteType: Stores information about flight routes, departure/arrival cities, and day of the trip. 
• ReservationType: Manages passenger reservations, including trip type, passenger names, and flight 
routes. 
• CityType: Contains data regarding cities serviced by the airline, with departure/arrival flight lists and 
adjacent cities. 
• FlightNumberListType: Maintains a list of flight numbers and associated flights. 
2.2 Design Considerations 
The system design focuses on scalability, reliability, and performance. Utilizing appropriate data structures and 
algorithms ensures efficient flight data management, passenger booking, and route finding functionalities. 
3 Implementation Details 
3.1 Code Structure 
The implementation is structured around various functional modules: 
• Flight and City Management: Handles flight information, city connections, and adjacency lists. 
2 
• Reservation Handling: Manages passenger reservations, categorizing them based on trip type and 
associated flights. 
• Data Display and Algorithms: Implements functions to display flight information, find routes, and 
provide reservation details. 
3.2 Key Functions and Algorithms 
Detailed descriptions of functions: 
• AddFlightToCityList: Adds flights to departure and arrival lists for respective cities. 
• AddReservation: Manages the addition of passenger reservations based on sorting criteria. 
• DijkstraShortestPath: Implements Dijkstra’s algorithm for finding the shortest path between cities. 
• DFSFindAllRoutes: Implements Depth-First Search to find all possible routes between two cities. 
4 Results and Discussion 
4.1 Key Features of the Code 
The implemented code showcases several key features: Data 
Structures: 
• FlightType: Encapsulates flight information such as flight number, origin, destination, departure and 
arrival times, and passenger count. 
• CityType: Represents cities within the airline’s network, storing connected flights and adjacent cities 
essential for route finding. 
• ReservationType: Manages passenger reservations, storing details like passenger names, trip types, and 
flight information. 
• FlightNumberListType: Facilitates maintaining an ordered list of flight numbers for efficient search 
operations. 
Functionality: 
• Flight and City Management: Creation, addition, and display of flight information including departure 
and arrival details. Presentation of all cities serviced by the airline. Retrieval of cities reachable from a 
specific city. 
• Route Finding: Utilization of Dijkstra’s algorithm to determine the shortest path between two cities. 
Implementation of Depth-First Search (DFS) to identify all feasible routes between two cities. 
• Passenger Management: Displaying a sorted list of passengers for a given flight, organized by last name. 
• Departure and Arrival Information: Exhibiting flight departures or arrivals for a city, sorted 
chronologically by time. 
4.2 Potential Areas for Improvement 
The code exhibits strong foundational elements; however, there are areas that can be enhanced: 
User Input and Interaction: Implementing features for user input would enhance the code’s practicality 
and usability. This could involve creating interfaces for data entry, reservation making, and query execution. 
3 
Error Handling: Integrating comprehensive error handling mechanisms would augment the code’s 
robustness, addressing potential issues like invalid inputs or data inconsistencies gracefully. 
Code Organization: Refactoring certain functions into distinct modules could significantly enhance code 
readability and maintainability, ensuring a more structured and comprehensible codebase. 
Additional Features: Expansion of functionalities, including reservation creation and cancellation, flight 
availability checks, passenger information display, fare management, and a user interface implementation (e.g., 
command-line or graphical), would significantly enrich the system’s capabilities and user experience. 
4.3 Discussion and Conclusion 
The implemented code presents a promising foundation for an Airline Reservation System, displaying critical 
functionalities for flight and passenger management, route finding, and data display. By addressing the 
identified areas for improvement and incorporating additional features, the system could evolve into a 
comprehensive and user-friendly application, offering an enhanced reservation experience for both passengers 
and airline operators. 
5 Conclusion 
The Airline Reservation System successfully achieves its defined objectives by providing a robust platform for 
passengers to make reservations and facilitating efficient flight management. The system’s user-friendly 
interface, accurate information retrieval, and route optimization contribute to enhanced customer satisfaction 
and operational effectiveness.
